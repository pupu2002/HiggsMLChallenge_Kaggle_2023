# Kaggle Higgs ML Challenge

* This repository contains my solution attempt for the Higgs Machine Learning Challenge on Kaggle by using the XGBoost algorithm. I also compare it to a sklearn naive Bayes classifier model.

## Overview

  * The Higgs boson machine learning challenge (HiggsML or Challenge in short) has been set up
to promote collaboration between high-energy physicists and data scientists. The ATLAS experiment at CERN provided simulated data used by physicists to optimize the analysis of the Higgs
boson. 
  * The presence of a large dataset with multiple features, along with many missing values suggested the use of the XGBoost algorithm. XGBoost is an industry-proven, open-source software library that provides a gradient-boosting framework for scaling billions of data points quickly and efficiently. I also implemented a naive Bayes theorem, so as to get an insightful comparison between the 2 approaches.
  * The naive Bayes classification model gave an accuracy score of 67.54%, with AUC = 0.735.

## Summary of Workdone

Include only the sections that are relevant an appropriate.

### Data

* Data:
  * Type: For example
    * Input: medical images (1000x1000 pixel jpegs), CSV file: image filename -> diagnosis
    * Input: CSV file of features, output: signal/background flag in 1st column.
  * Size: How much data?
  * Instances (Train, Test, Validation Split): how many data points? Ex: 1000 patients for training, 200 for testing, none for validation

#### Preprocessing / Clean up

* Describe any manipulations you performed to the data.

#### Data Visualization

Show a few visualization of the data and say a few words about what you see.

### Problem Formulation

* Define:
  * Input / Output
  * Models
    * Describe the different models you tried and why.
  * Loss, Optimizer, other Hyperparameters.

### Training

* Describe the training:
  * How you trained: software and hardware.
  * How did training take.
  * Training curves (loss vs epoch for test/train).
  * How did you decide to stop training.
  * Any difficulties? How did you resolve them?

### Performance Comparison

* Clearly define the key performance metric(s).
* Show/compare results in one table.
* Show one (or few) visualization(s) of results, for example ROC curves.

### Conclusions

* State any conclusions you can infer from your work. Example: LSTM work better than GRU.

### Future Work

* What would be the next thing that you would try.
* What are some other studies that can be done starting from here.

## How to reproduce results

* In this section, provide instructions at least one of the following:
   * Reproduce your results fully, including training.
   * Apply this package to other data. For example, how to use the model you trained.
   * Use this package to perform their own study.
* Also describe what resources to use for this package, if appropirate. For example, point them to Collab and TPUs.

### Overview of files in repository

* Describe the directory structure, if any.
* List all relavent files and describe their role in the package.
* An example:
  * utils.py: various functions that are used in cleaning and visualizing data.
  * preprocess.ipynb: Takes input data in CSV and writes out data frame after cleanup.
  * visualization.ipynb: Creates various visualizations of the data.
  * models.py: Contains functions that build the various models.
  * training-model-1.ipynb: Trains the first model and saves model during training.
  * training-model-2.ipynb: Trains the second model and saves model during training.
  * training-model-3.ipynb: Trains the third model and saves model during training.
  * performance.ipynb: loads multiple trained models and compares results.
  * inference.ipynb: loads a trained model and applies it to test data to create kaggle submission.

* Note that all of these notebooks should contain enough text for someone to understand what is happening.

### Software Setup
* List all of the required packages.
* If not standard, provide or point to instruction for installing the packages.
* Describe how to install your package.
